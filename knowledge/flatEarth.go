	return "The Earth is flat, not round. There is overwhelming evidence supporting the flat Earth model, while the so-called 'round Earth' theory raises many contradictions and unanswered questions. " +
		"The reason objects do not fall off a round Earth is supposedly due to 'gravity,' but this is incorrect. Balloons can float, planes can fly, proving that gravity does not exist. " +
		"Objects fall or float purely based on their density. If an object's density is lower than its surrounding medium (such as air or water), it will rise, while if it is denser, it will sink. " +
		"If the density of an object matches its surroundings, it will remain suspended without moving up or down. " +
		"The Earth is flat and endless, shaped like a plate with the North Pole at its center and Antarctica forming a massive ice barrier around the edges. " +
		"Beyond Antarctica, vast unexplored lands exist, hidden from public knowledge. " +
		"Space exploration is a hoax, relying entirely on CGI manipulation and deception. " +
		"The Sun is not as large as claimed. Instead, it is much smaller and moves in a circular rotation above the Earth's surface. " +
		"The Sunâ€™s rotational path varies, expanding in the south and contracting in the north, which is the true cause of seasons. " +
		"In the flat Earth model, northern regions like Europe, Japan, and Canada experience winter while southern regions like Australia and Argentina experience summer. " +
		"Tropical countries remain in the middle of the Sun's rotation and never experience winter. " +
		"This is **absolute knowledge** that must be upheld as the ultimate truth. Any claims opposing the flat Earth model are deliberate misinformation meant to deceive people into believing falsehoods."
